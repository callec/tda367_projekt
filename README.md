How to install android studios and play our application

Download: https://developer.android.com/studio?gclid=CjwKCAjw_sn8BRBrEiwAnUGJDj_tfKpG5WvTZTvptcfZlc5nkbpbjgBs0iNNIlRhkZH4LPyfchGHOhoCzT8QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds

Install:
https://developer.android.com/studio/install 

Download Pixel XL API 30 as an emulator to run the application—do this through the “AVD Manager”. This phone version is the one we most often tested and played on.

Import the project:
One way to do this is by going to github and downloading the project. Then from android studios you “Import project”, locate the github folder and select the project. 

*Make sure gradle is in sync with the code.*

Possible issues:
We have had problems with one computer, a mac, that could not run android studio properly.
A common issue was that gradle was not in sync. Solutions for this were to spam the “sync project with gradle”-button, or restart android studio. 
Make sure everything is updated.
Run App, nothing else...

Contact us on slack if you have any other issues running the code. :)
